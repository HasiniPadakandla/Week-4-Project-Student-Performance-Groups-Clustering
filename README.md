**Week-4-Project-Student-Performance-Groups-Clustering**

**PROJECT NAME : Student Performance Groups Clustering (PCA, K-Means, Silhouette)**

**PROJECT DOMAIN : EdTech**

**PREPARED BY : P. V. N. S. Hasini**

The clustering analysis on the student-por.csv dataset successfully grouped students into three distinct performance clusters based on their grades (G1, G2, G3) and related demographic/behavioral attributes. Using PCA for dimensionality reduction and KMeans clustering with silhouette-based tuning. The clusters are separated into : High Performers, Average Students, At Risk. This segmentation provides actionable insights for educators and decision-makers in tailoring interventions and support strategies.
